# MLThursdays
Documenting machine learning examples and mini projects. 
Examples : 

1)ML classifier in python using Scikit-Learn : 
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Database. The dataset includes various information about breast cancer tumors, as well as classification labels of malignant or benign. The dataset has 5 6 9 instances, or data, on 569 tumors and includes information on 30 attributes, or features, such as the radius of the tumor, texture, smoothness, and area.

2)Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits with Tensorflow : 
The dataset used is the MNIST Dataset.
